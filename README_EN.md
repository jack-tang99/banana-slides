The public demo provides fixed model configurations for Inferera, APIMart, and Volcengine Agent Plan, with API keys isolated per guest. The public version does not provide history records; please save the preview page link to access it again. Extra field configurations for descriptions are fixed, while the main body and generation requirements remain editable. Service tests on the settings page can run simultaneously, displaying results individually. The "Project Settings -> Personal Settings" on both the home and preview pages reuse the open-source version's forms, provider hover information, and Key acquisition guides; personal configurations saved in either location take effect synchronously. Site owners can set `PUBLIC_DEMO_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env` and view history via the `/admin/history` password entry. See [Public Demo Usage and Migration Guide](docs/zh/public-demo.mdx).

## ✨ Project Origin

Have you ever found yourself in this dilemma: the presentation is due tomorrow, yet your slides remain blank? You have countless brilliant ideas, but all your passion is drained by tedious layout and design work.

We all long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and aesthetically pleasing. While traditional AI PPT generators generally satisfy the need for "speed," they still suffer from the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Only preset templates available, with no flexibility to adjust styles.
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making multi-round revisions difficult.
- 3️⃣ Highly homogenized results with a repetitive visual feel.
- 4️⃣ Low-quality assets that lack specificity.
- 5️⃣ Disjointed text-image layouts with poor design sense.

These deficiencies make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously meet the two major requirements of "speed" and "beauty." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPT" are, in my eyes, far from being truly "Vibe."

However, the emergence of the **nano banana 🍌** model has changed everything. I experimented with **🍌pro** to generate slide pages and found that the results were exceptional in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. It accurately renders almost all text requested in the prompts and strictly follows the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on **🍌pro**?

## 👨‍💻 Applicable Scenarios

1. **Beginners**: Quickly generate beautiful PPTs with zero barrier to entry and no design experience required, reducing the hassle of choosing templates.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Reference AI-generated layouts and combinations of graphics and text to quickly gain design inspiration.
3. **Educators**: Rapidly convert teaching content into illustrated lesson plan PPTs to enhance classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Quickly complete assignment presentations, allowing energy to be focused on content rather than layout and aesthetics.
5. **Business Professionals**: Rapidly visualize business proposals and product introductions with quick adaptation to various scenarios.

<p>
  <b>🎯Goal: Lower the barrier to PPT creation, enabling everyone to quickly create beautiful and professional presentations</b>

# Proxy Example: https://api.inferera.com/v1

# SenseTime SenseNova U1 Image Model (Retaining old Provider, images use OpenAI compatible path)

# Recommendation: Keep Using Gemini for Text, Route Only Images via SenseTime

As we all know, while Google Gemini is powerful, direct access and usage of its image generation features in certain regions may be subject to restrictions. Meanwhile, SenseTime, as a leader among domestic large models, performs excellently with its text-to-image model "SenseMirage" in understanding Chinese contexts and generating high-quality images.

So, how can we combine the strengths of both to achieve a seamless experience of "using Gemini for text dialogue and switching to SenseTime for drawing tasks"?

## Core Idea

We utilize open-source tools (such as One API or New API) for protocol conversion and distribution.

1. **Configure One API**: Integrate Gemini and SenseTime APIs into the One API platform.
2. **Channel Redirection/Mapping**: Set up special model name mappings or leverage One API's channel priority features.
3. **Frontend Invocation**: In frontend chat tools (such as ChatGPT-Next-Web), continue selecting the Gemini model for dialogue. When drawing is needed, trigger specific keywords or call specific SenseTime image model interfaces.

## Why Choose This Combination?

*   **Logical Reasoning and Creative Writing (Gemini)**: Gemini Pro/Ultra maintains top-tier performance in handling complex logic and long-form text creation.
*   **Localized Image Generation (SenseTime)**: SenseTime's SenseMirage understands Chinese prompts more accurately, generates styles that better suit local aesthetics, and offers fast API response speeds.
*   **Cost Optimization**: By rationally allocating quotas, combining Gemini's free tier (if applicable) with SenseTime's promotional packages offers extremely high cost-performance.

## Simple Configuration Steps

1. Obtain a Gemini API Key.
2. Register on the SenseTime Large Model Open Platform and obtain an API Key.
3. Add a Gemini channel in One API.
4. Add a SenseTime channel in One API, selecting the model as `sensetime-art` (example).
5. Configure the Base URL and Key of One API in the chat frontend.

## Conclusion

This "hybrid" solution preserves Gemini's powerful brain while adding the artistic wings of SenseTime. It is currently the recommended approach for balancing efficiency and effectiveness.

> Banana Slides explicitly packages the LazyLLM online provider SDKs used by domestic vendors:
> `volcengine-python-sdk[ark]` for Doubao, `dashscope` for Qwen/Wanxiang, and `zhipuai` for GLM/Zhipu.
> LazyLLM also exposes `lazyllm install online-advanced`, but the PyPI wheel may not publish that group as a standard install extra, so Docker/prebuilt images rely on these explicit dependencies instead.
>
> Desktop (PyInstaller) builds register every LazyLLM online vendor explicitly
> (qwen, doubao, deepseek, glm, kimi, minimax, sensenova, siliconflow, ppio,

**Use the new editable export configuration method for better results**: You need to obtain an API KEY from the [Baidu Intelligent Cloud Platform](https://console.bce.baidu.com/iam/#/iam/apikey/list) (click here to access) and fill it into the `BAIDU_API_KEY` field in the `.env` file (comes with a generous free quota). For details, see the instructions in https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121.

  <summary>📒 Vertex AI Configuration Guide (For GCP Users)</summary>

Google Cloud Vertex AI allows calling Gemini models via a GCP Service Account, and new users can use their free trial credits. Configuration steps:

1. Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a service account, and download the JSON key file.
2. Save the key file as `gcp-service-account.json` in the project root directory.
3. Set the following in `.env`:
   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=global
   ```
4. If using Docker deployment, you also need to uncomment the relevant sections in `docker-compose.yml` to mount the key file into the container and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

> The `gemini-3-*` series models require `VERTEX_LOCATION=global`.

</details>

2. **Start the Service**

**⚡ Using Pre-built Images (Recommended)**

The project provides pre-built frontend and backend images on Docker Hub (synced with the latest version of the main branch), allowing you to skip the local build steps for rapid deployment:

```bash

# Start with Pre-built Images (No Need to Build from Scratch)

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Image names:
- `anoinex/banana-slides-frontend:latest`
- `anoinex/banana-slides-backend:latest`

After starting, you can go to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** within the application. The application will determine if there is an update available based on the current version SHA; when running from source, the current Git SHA will also be used for comparison.

**Build images from scratch**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```


> [!TIP]
> If you encounter network issues, you can uncomment the mirror source configurations in the `.env` file and then rerun the startup command:
> ```env
> # Uncomment the following in the .env file to use mirror sources
> DOCKER_REGISTRY=docker.1ms.run/
> GHCR_REGISTRY=ghcr.nju.edu.cn/
> APT_MIRROR=mirrors.aliyun.com
> PYPI_INDEX_URL=https://mirrors.cloud.tencent.com/pypi/simple
> NPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com/
> ```


3. **Accessing the Application**

- Frontend: http://localhost:3011
- Backend API: http://localhost:5011

4. **Viewing Logs**

```bash
```

# View Backend Logs (Last 200 Lines)

docker logs --tail 200 banana-slides-backend

# View Backend Logs in Real-time (Last 100 Lines)

docker logs -f --tail 100 banana-slides-backend

# View Frontend Logs (Last 100 Lines)

docker logs --tail 100 banana-slides-frontend
```

5. **Stop Services**

```bash
docker compose down
```

6. **Update Project**

**Using Pre-built Images (docker-compose.prod.yml)**

You can also go to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** within the app to see if a new version is available.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

**Using Local Build (docker-compose.yml)**

Note: If you have manually modified the code, this method is not applicable; you must first revert the code to the version at the time of pulling.

```bash
git pull 
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

### Deploy from Source

#### Environment Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Python package manager
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - Required for narrated video export, and must include `libass` / `ass` subtitle filter support
- A valid Google Gemini API key
- (Optional) [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - Required when uploading PPTX files using the "PPT Refurbishment" feature to convert PPTX to PDF. **It is recommended to convert PPTX to PDF locally before uploading.** Reason: LibreOffice may cause layout misalignments during server-side rendering due to missing fonts (such as Microsoft YaHei, Calibri, etc.) and cannot fully restore some special effects. Uploading PDF files does not require LibreOffice. Docker users who still need to support PPTX uploads within the container can execute:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it banana-slides-backend bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y libreoffice-impress && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*"
  ```
  > Note: LibreOffice installed this way will be lost after the container is rebuilt and must be reinstalled.

#### Backend Installation

0. **Clone the code repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides
cd banana-slides
```

1. **Install uv (if not already installed)**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. **Install dependencies**

Run the following in the project root directory:
```bash

# macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew install ffmpeg-full
brew unlink ffmpeg 2>/dev/null || true
brew link --overwrite --force ffmpeg-full
```

# Ubuntu / Debian

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg libass9

# Then Install Python Dependencies

uv sync
```bash
uv sync
```

This will automatically install all dependencies based on `pyproject.toml`.

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

Copy the environment variable template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

# Next, open and edit the `.env` file as previously described to configure your API key

Please provide the Chinese Markdown content you would like me to translate. There was no original content included in your request.

#### Frontend Installation

1. **Enter the frontend directory**
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure API address**

The frontend will automatically connect to the backend service specified by `BACKEND_PORT` via Vite proxy (default `http://localhost:5011`). If you need to modify this, please set `BACKEND_PORT` in the `.env` file at the project root.

#### Start Backend Service

> (Optional) If there is important local data, it is recommended to back up the database before upgrading:  
> `cp backend/instance/database.db backend/instance/database.db.bak`
> Note: Under default configuration, templates, assets, and outputs are all located in the `uploads/` folder.

```bash
cd backend
uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run python app.py
```

The backend service will start at `http://localhost:5011`.

Visit `http://localhost:5011/health` to verify that the service is running correctly.

#### Start front-end development server

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend development server will start at `http://localhost:3011`.

Open your browser and visit the address to use the application.
