The public demo provides fixed model configurations for Inferera, APIMart, and Volcengine Agent Plan, with API keys isolated per visitor. The public version does not offer history storage; please save the preview page link to access it again. Extra field configurations for descriptions are fixed, but the main content and generation requirements remain editable. Tests for various services on the settings page can run simultaneously, displaying results individually. The "Project Settings → Personal Settings" on both the home settings page and the preview page use the same provider buttons and advantage descriptions; personal configurations saved in either place take effect synchronously. Site administrators can set `PUBLIC_DEMO_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env` to view history via the `/admin/history` password entry. See [Public Demo Usage and Migration Instructions](docs/zh/public-demo.mdx).

- **[2026-03]**: Added several features and optimizations, such as additional fields and multi-ratio settings.

## ✨ Project Origin

Have you ever found yourself in this predicament: the presentation is due tomorrow, but the slides are still a total blank; your mind is brimming with brilliant ideas, but all your enthusiasm is drained by tedious layout and design?

We long for the ability to quickly create presentations that are both professional and design-oriented. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the demand for "speed," they still face the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Limited to preset templates, with no flexibility to adjust styles
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making multi-round iterations difficult
- 3️⃣ Similar visual appearance with severe homogenization
- 4️⃣ Low-quality assets that lack specificity
- 5️⃣ Fragmented text-image layouts with a poor sense of design

These flaws make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously satisfy our two core requirements: "speed" and "aesthetics." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPTs" are, in my eyes, far from being truly "Vibe."

However, the emergence of the nano banana 🍌 model has changed everything. I experimented with 🍌pro for PPT page generation and found that the results were exceptional in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. Moreover, it can accurately render almost all text requested in the prompts while strictly following the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Applicable Scenarios

1. **Beginners**: Quickly generate beautiful PPTs with zero barrier to entry, no design experience required, and no more hassle choosing templates.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Gain design inspiration quickly by referencing AI-generated layouts and combinations of visual and text elements.
3. **Educators**: Quickly convert teaching content into illustrated lesson plan PPTs to enhance classroom engagement.
4. **Students**: Quickly complete presentation assignments, focusing effort on content rather than formatting and aesthetics.
5. **Professionals**: Quickly visualize business proposals and product introductions, with rapid adaptation for various scenarios.

<p>
  <b>🎯Goal: Lower the barrier to PPT creation, enabling everyone to quickly create beautiful and professional presentations.</b>

> Banana Slides explicitly packages the LazyLLM online provider SDKs used by domestic vendors:
> `volcengine-python-sdk[ark]` for Doubao, `dashscope` for Qwen/Wanxiang, and `zhipuai` for GLM/Zhipu.
> LazyLLM also exposes `lazyllm install online-advanced`, but the PyPI wheel may not publish that group as a standard install extra, so Docker/prebuilt images rely on these explicit dependencies instead.
>
> Desktop (PyInstaller) builds register every LazyLLM online vendor explicitly
> (qwen, doubao, deepseek, glm, kimi, minimax, sensenova, siliconflow, ppio,
> aiping, openai) so packaged backends never hit `Unsupported source: ...`.

**Use the new editable export configuration method to get better editable export results**: You need to obtain an API KEY from the [Baidu Intelligent Cloud Platform](https://console.bce.baidu.com/iam/#/iam/apikey/list) (click here to enter) and fill it in the `BAIDU_API_KEY` field in the `.env` file (there is a sufficient free usage quota). See the instructions in https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121 for details.


<details>
  <summary>📒 Vertex AI Configuration Guide (For GCP Users)</summary>

Google Cloud Vertex AI allows calling Gemini models through GCP service accounts, and new users can use free credits. Configuration steps:

1. Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a service account, and download the JSON format key file.
2. Save the key file as `gcp-service-account.json` in the project root directory.
3. Set the following in `.env`:
   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=global
   ```
4. If deploying with Docker, you also need to uncomment the relevant sections in `docker-compose.yml` to mount the key file into the container and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

> The `gemini-3-*` series models require `VERTEX_LOCATION=global`.

</details>

2. **Start Service**

**⚡ Use Pre-built Images (Recommended)**

The project provides pre-built frontend and backend images on Docker Hub (synced with the latest version of the main branch). You can skip the local build step for fast deployment:

```bash

# Start with Pre-built Images (No need to build from scratch)

docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Image names:
- `anoinex/banana-slides-frontend:latest`
- `anoinex/banana-slides-backend:latest`

After starting, you can go to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** within the application. The app will determine if an update is available based on the current version SHA; the Git SHA will also be used for comparison when running from source.

**Build images from scratch**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```


> [!TIP]
> In case of network issues, you can uncomment the mirror source configuration in the `.env` file and rerun the startup command:
> ```env
> # Uncomment the following in the .env file to use domestic mirror sources
> DOCKER_REGISTRY=docker.1ms.run/
> GHCR_REGISTRY=ghcr.nju.edu.cn/
> APT_MIRROR=mirrors.aliyun.com
> PYPI_INDEX_URL=https://mirrors.cloud.tencent.com/pypi/simple
> NPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com/
> ```


3. **Access the Application**

- Frontend: http://localhost:3011
- Backend API: http://localhost:5011

4. **View Logs**

```bash

# View Backend Logs (Last 200 Lines)

docker logs --tail 200 banana-slides-backend

# View Backend Logs in Real-time (Last 100 Lines)

docker logs -f --tail 100 banana-slides-backend

# View Frontend Logs (Last 100 Lines)

docker logs --tail 100 banana-slides-frontend
```

5. **Stop Services**

```bash
docker compose down
```

6. **Update Project**

**Using Pre-built Images (docker-compose.prod.yml)**

Alternatively, you can go to **Settings → About → Check for Updates** within the application to see if a new version is available.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

**Using Local Build (docker-compose.yml)**

Note: If the code has been manually modified, this method is not applicable; you need to revert the code to the pulled version first.

```bash
git pull 
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

### Deploy from source

#### Environment Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Python package manager
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - Required for exporting narration videos, and must include `libass` / `ass` subtitle filter support
- Valid Google Gemini API key
- (Optional) [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - Required when using the "PPT Refurbishment" feature to upload PPTX files, used for converting PPTX to PDF. **It is recommended to convert PPTX to PDF locally before uploading.** Reason: When rendering on the server, LibreOffice may cause layout displacement due to missing fonts (such as Microsoft YaHei, Calibri, etc.) and cannot fully restore some special effects. Uploading PDF files does not require LibreOffice. For Docker users who still need PPTX upload support within the container, you can execute:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it banana-slides-backend bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y libreoffice-impress && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*"
  ```
  > Note: LibreOffice installed this way will be lost after the container is rebuilt and will need to be reinstalled.

#### Backend Installation

0. **Clone the code repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides
cd banana-slides
```

1. **Install uv (if not already installed)**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. **Install dependencies**

Run the following command in the project root directory:
```bash

# macOS (Homebrew)

brew install ffmpeg-full
brew unlink ffmpeg 2>/dev/null || true
brew link --overwrite --force ffmpeg-full

# Ubuntu / Debian

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg libass9
```

# Then install Python dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

This will automatically install all dependencies based on `pyproject.toml`.

3. **Configure environment variables**

Copy the environment variable template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

# Then, following the method described above, open and edit the `.env` file to configure your API key.

#### Frontend Installation

1. **Enter the frontend directory**
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure API address**

The frontend will automatically connect to the backend service specified by `BACKEND_PORT` via Vite proxy (default `http://localhost:5011`). If you need to modify this, please set `BACKEND_PORT` in the `.env` file in the project root directory.

#### Start Backend Service

> (Optional) If you have important data locally, it is recommended to back up the database before upgrading:  
> `cp backend/instance/database.db backend/instance/database.db.bak`
> Note: Under the default configuration, templates, assets, and final products are all located in the uploads/ folder

```bash
cd backend
uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run python app.py
```

The backend service will start at `http://localhost:5011`.

Visit `http://localhost:5011/health` to verify if the service is running correctly.

#### Start Frontend Development Server

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend development server will start at `http://localhost:3011`.

Open your browser to access and use the application.
