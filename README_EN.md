## ✨ Project Origin

Have you ever found yourself in this predicament: your presentation is tomorrow, yet the slides are still blank; your mind is full of brilliant ideas, but your enthusiasm is drained by tedious layout and design?

We long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and well-designed. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally satisfy the need for "speed," they still face the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Can only choose from preset templates, with no flexibility to adjust styles
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making multi-round revisions difficult 
- 3️⃣ Similar visual appearance, leading to severe homogenization
- 4️⃣ Low material quality and lack of relevance
- 5️⃣ Disjointed text-image layout and poor sense of design

These flaws make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously satisfy our dual needs for "speed" and "aesthetics." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPTs" fall far short of being truly "Vibe" in my eyes.

However, the emergence of the nano banana🍌 model has changed everything. I tried using 🍌pro for PPT page generation and found that the results were excellent in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. Furthermore, it can accurately render almost all text requested in the prompts while following the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Use Cases

1. **Novices**: Quickly generate aesthetically pleasing PPTs with zero threshold; no design experience required, reducing the hassle of selecting templates.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Reference AI-generated layouts and combinations of text and graphic elements to quickly gain design inspiration.
3. **Educators**: Rapidly convert teaching content into illustrated lesson plan PPTs to enhance classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Quickly complete presentation assignments, focusing efforts on content rather than formatting and aesthetics.
5. **Professionals**: Rapidly visualize business proposals and product introductions, with quick adaptation for various scenarios.

## **🔧 FAQ**

1. **Garbled or blurry text on generated pages**
    - You can select a higher resolution output (the OpenAI format may not support resolution adjustments; Gemini format is recommended). According to tests, increasing the resolution from 1k to 2k before generating the page significantly improves text rendering quality.
    - Please ensure that the page description includes the specific text content to be rendered.

2. **Poor results when exporting editable PPT, such as overlapping text or missing styles**
    - In 90% of cases, this is due to API configuration issues. You can refer to the troubleshooting and solutions in [issue 121](https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121).

3. **Is the free tier Gemini API Key supported?**
    - The free tier only supports text generation and does not support image generation.

4. **503 error or Retry Error when generating content**
    - You can check the Docker backend logs using the commands in the README to locate the detailed error for the 503 issue. This is usually caused by incorrect model configuration.

5. **Why doesn't the API Key take effect after being set in .env?**
    - After editing `.env` during runtime, you need to restart the Docker container to apply the changes.
    - If parameters were previously configured in the web settings page, they will override the parameters in `.env`. You can revert to the `.env` settings by using "Restore Default Settings."
